  <h1 class="heading">TOMATO FACTS</h1>
  <p class="copy">Tomatoes were introduced to Italy in the early 16th century but many folks feared they were poisonous 
    since they belonged to the nightshade family (peppers, potatoes and eggplant also belong to this family). 
    The French, however, felt differently about tomatoes and called them &quot;pomme d&#39;amour&quot; (a.k.a. love apples). 
    Colonists who settled in Virginia brought tomatoes with them, but they didn&#39;t become popular until the 
    19th century.</p>
